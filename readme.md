# World Factbook

A small site that allows for a user to search for a country based on one of a number of categories and view some basic information related to it. Inspiration taken from the CIA World Factbook (https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), which I loved to play around with when I was young.

Built using node, express, ejs, and node-fetch as well as with the help of the free APIs listed below (can also be found on the homepage of the site as well):
1. [REST Countries v1 API](https://rapidapi.com/apilayernet/api/rest-countries-v1)
2. [Country Flags](https://www.countryflags.io/)
3. [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
